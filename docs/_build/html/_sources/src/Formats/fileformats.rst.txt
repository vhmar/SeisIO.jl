Performance Tip
===============
With mseed or win32 data, adjust `nx_new` and `nx_add` based on the sizes of
the data vectors that you expect to read. If the largest has `Nmax` samples,
and the smallest has `Nmin`, we recommend `nx_new=Nmin` and `nx_add=Nmax-Nmin`.

Default values can be changed in SeisIO keywords, e.g.,
::

  SeisIO.KW.nx_new = 60000
  SeisIO.KW.nx_add = 360000

The system-wide defaults are `nx_new=86400000` and `nx_add=360000`. Using these
values with very small jobs will greatly decrease performance.

Examples
--------

1. ``S = read_data("uw", "99011116541W", full=true)``
    + Read UW-format data file ``99011116541W``
    + Store full header information in ``:misc``
2. ``read_data!(S, "sac", "MSH80*.SAC")``
    + Read SAC-format files matching string pattern `MSH80*.SAC`
    + Read into existing SeisData object ``S``
3. ``S = read_data("win32", "20140927*.cnt", cf="20140927*ch", nx_new=360000)``
    + Read win32-format data files with names matching pattern ``2014092709*.cnt``
    + Use ASCII channel information filenames that match pattern ``20140927*ch``
    + Assign new channels an initial size of ``nx_new`` samples

Format Descriptions and Notes
*****************************

`GeoCSV\ <http://geows.ds.iris.edu/documents/GeoCSV.pdf>`_: an extension of "human-readable", tabular file format Comma-
Separated Values (CSV).

**Lennartz ASCII**: ASCII output of Lennartz portable digitizers.

`PASSCAL\ <https://www.passcal.nmt.edu/content/seg-y-what-it-is>`_: A single-channel variant SEG Y format developed by PASSCAL/New
Mexico Tech and commonly used with PASSCAL field equipment. PASSCAL differs from
SEG Y in that PASSCAL format uses neither file headers nor extended textural
headers, and the number of samples per trace can exceed 32767.

`SEED\ <https://www.fdsn.org/seed_manual/SEEDManual_V2.4.pdf>`_: SEED stands for
Standard for the Exchange of Earthquake Data; used by the International
Federation of Digital Seismograph Networks (FDSN) as an omnibus seismic data
standard. mini-SEED is a data-only variant that uses only data blockettes
and allows longer data records.

`SAC\ <https://ds.iris.edu/files/sac-manual/manual/file_format.html>`_: the
Seismic Analysis Code data format, originally developed for the eponymous
command-line interpreter. Widely used, and supported in virtually every
programming language.

`SEG Y\ <http://wiki.seg.org/wiki/SEG_Y>`_: Society of Exploration Geophysicists
data format. Common in the energy industry, developed and maintained by the SEG.
Only SEG Y rev 0 and `rev 1\ <https://seg.org/Portals/0/SEG/News%20and%20Resources/Technical%20Standards/seg_y_rev1.pdf>`_
with standard headers are supported.

**UW**: the University of Washington data format has no online reference and is
no longer in use. Created by the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network for event
archival; used through the early 2000s. A UW event is described by a pickfile
and a corresponding data file, whose names are identical except for the last
character; for example, the files 99062109485o and 99062109485W
describe event 99062109485. Unlike the win32 data format, the data file is
self-contained; the pick file is not required to use raw trace data. Only UW-2
data files are supported by SeisIO; we have never encountered a UW-1 data file
outside of Exabyte tapes and have no reason to suspect that any remain in
circulation.

`Win32\ <http://eoc.eri.u-tokyo.ac.jp/WIN/Eindex.html>`_: data format developed
by the NIED (National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Prevention),
Japan.  Data are typically divided into files that contain a minute of continuous
data from several channels. Data within each file are stored by channel in
one-second segments as variable-precision delta-encoded integers. Channel
information is retrieved from an external channel information file. Although
accurate channel files are needed to use win32 data, these files are not strictly
controlled by any central authority and inconsistencies in channel parameters,
particularly gains, are known to exist.

Other File I/O Functions
************************

.. function:: readuwevt(fpat)

Read University of Washington-format event data with file pattern stub fpat.
fstub can be a datafile name, a pickname, or a stub.

.. function:: rseis(fname)

Read SeisIO native format data into an array of SeisIO structures.

.. function:: sachdr(fname)

Print headers from SAC file to stdout.

.. function:: segyhdr(fname[, PASSCAL=true::Bool])

Print headers from SEG Y file to stdout. Specify ``passcal=true`` for PASSCAL SEG Y.

.. function:: uwdf(dfname)

Parse UW event data file ``dfname`` into a new SeisEvent structure.

.. function:: uwpf!(evt, pfname)

Parse UW event pick file into SeisEvent structure.

.. function:: uwpf(pfname)

Parse UW event pick file ``pfname`` into a new SeisEvent structure.

.. function:: writesac(S[, ts=true])

Write SAC data to SAC files with auto-generated names. Specify ts=true to write
time stamps; this will flag the file as generic x-y data in the SAC interpreter.

.. function:: wseis(fname, S)
.. function:: wseis(fname, S, T, U...)

Write SeisIO data to fname. Multiple objects can be written at once.
